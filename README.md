# hack to school

Welcome everyone to hack to school hackathon! Today, we will be putting the skills that we've learned in the past event, the 10 Days Project, to work by collaborating with your team and tackling some challenges together.

This event is designed to help you improve your coding skills and work more effectively as a team. You should update your work with your team, communicating with other members, and using your competitive spirit to push yourselves out of your comfort zones and take on more difficult tasks.

Remember, the goal is not to be perfect, but to learn and grow as a team. So let's get started and see what we can accomplish together!

## Rules

1. We provide you with two types of requirements: "Must Done" and "Optional".
  - "Must Done" requirements are essential and are designed for everyone. They are generally easier and have a significant score value.
  - "Optional" requirements are optional. The score value varies from low to very high. You should aim to score as much as possible, as this can help you win. It is important to plan wisely before deciding which requirements to complete.
2. Your final commit must be made before **13 Jan 23:59**.
3. Please do not allow anyone outside of your team to work on your behalf.
4. If you have any questions, feel free to ask our staff in the Thinc. Discord.
